# MoveFolders
Moves all the files within a subfolder containing "HSV" in the folder name to a new location

A quick script I wrote for reorganizing data files (Sep 2023). There were several hundred high speed video (HSV) files (.mcf and .avi) that were in C:\...Project\Data\Run1\HSV, C:\...Project\Data\Run2\HSV etc.
The script iterates through all the folders in C:\...Porject\Data, finds the video files, and moves them all to one spot in C:\....Project\Videos
